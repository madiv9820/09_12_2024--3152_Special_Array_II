- ## Approach 3:- Prefix Sum

- ### Intuition
    The problem asks us to determine if a subarray is "special," meaning that every pair of adjacent elements in the subarray must contain numbers with different parity (one odd and one even). A naive solution would check each subarray for every query, but this approach would be inefficient for large arrays and many queries. Instead, we can optimize the solution by:

    1. **Precomputing the violations:** We create a list of violations where each element represents whether two adjacent elements in the array have the same parity.
    2. **Using a prefix sum array:** By computing the cumulative number of violations in the array, we can quickly check the number of violations in any subarray by calculating the difference in prefix sums for the range specified by the query.

    With this approach, we can efficiently determine whether each query's subarray is special without checking the entire subarray every time.

- ### Approach
    1. **Identify Violations:** 
        - For each pair of adjacent elements in the `nums` array, check if they have the same parity (both odd or both even). Store the result (1 for violation, 0 for no violation) in the `violations` array.
    
    2. **Prefix Sum Array:** 
        - Construct a `prefix_violations` array where each element represents the cumulative sum of violations up to that index. This allows us to quickly calculate the number of violations in any subarray.

    3. **Query Processing:**
        - For each query, calculate the number of violations in the subarray using the `prefix_violations` array. If the number of violations is zero in the range `[start, end]`, then the subarray is "special"; otherwise, it's not.

    4. **Return the Results:**
        - For each query, return `true` if the subarray is special, and `false` if it is not.

- ### Code Implementation
    
    - **Python Solution**
        ```python3 []
        class Solution:
            def isArraySpecial(self, nums: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[bool]:
                # Initialize an empty list to store the results for each query.
                answer = []
                
                # Get the length of the nums array.
                n = len(nums)
                
                # Create a list 'violations' where each element is 1 if the adjacent elements at the current index have the same parity, otherwise 0.
                violations = [1 if (nums[index] & 1) == (nums[index+1] & 1) else 0 for index in range(n-1)]

                # Create a prefix sum array to store cumulative number of violations up to each index.
                prefix_violations = [0] * (n+1)

                # Fill the prefix_violations array where each index i stores the number of violations from index 0 to i-1.
                for index in range(1, n):
                    prefix_violations[index] = prefix_violations[index-1] + violations[index-1]

                # For each query, check the number of violations in the subarray [start, end]
                # by checking the difference in prefix sums for the range [start, end].
                for start, end in queries:
                    # If the difference in prefix sums is 0, it means there are no violations in this range (subarray is special).
                    answer.append(prefix_violations[end] - prefix_violations[start] == 0)

                # Return the list of results for all queries.
                return answer
        ```

    - **C++ Solution**
        ```cpp []
        class Solution {
        public:
            vector<bool> isArraySpecial(vector<int>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
                // Initialize a vector to store the results for each query
                vector<bool> answer;

                // Get the size of the nums array
                int n = nums.size();

                // Create a vector to store '1' if adjacent elements have the same parity, '0' otherwise
                vector<int> violations(n-1, 0);

                // Iterate through the nums array to detect parity violations
                for(int index = 0; index < n-1; ++index)
                    // If adjacent elements have the same parity, mark it as a violation (1), otherwise (0)
                    violations[index] = (nums[index] & 1) == (nums[index+1] & 1);

                // Create a prefix sum array to store cumulative number of violations up to each index
                vector<int> prefix_violations(n+1, 0);

                // Iterate through the violations array to calculate the prefix sum of violations
                for(int index = 1; index < n; ++index)
                    // The cumulative number of violations at index 'i' is the sum of violations up to 'i-1'
                    prefix_violations[index] = prefix_violations[index-1] + violations[index-1];

                // Iterate through each query in the 'queries' vector
                for(const vector<int>& query: queries) {
                    // Extract the 'start' and 'end' indices from the current query
                    const int &start = query[0], &end = query[1];

                    // If the number of violations in the range [start, end] is zero, the subarray is "special"
                    answer.emplace_back((prefix_violations[end] - prefix_violations[start]) == 0);
                }

                // Return the vector containing results for all queries
                return answer;
            }
        };
        ```

- ### Time Complexity
    1. **Precomputing Violations:**
        - We loop through the `nums` array once to calculate the `violations` array, which takes $O(n)$ time, where $n$ is the length of `nums`.
    
    2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
        - Constructing the `prefix_violations` array requires another pass through the `nums` array, which takes $O(n)$ time.

    3. **Query Processing:**
        - For each query, calculating the number of violations in the range `[start, end]` can be done in constant time $O(1)$ using the `prefix_violations` array.
        - If there are $q$ queries, processing all queries takes $O(q)$ time.

    **Total Time Complexity:**
        - $O(n + q)$, where $n$ is the length of the `nums` array and $q$ is the number of queries.

- ### Space Complexity
    1. **Violations Array:**
        - We store a `violations` array of size $n-1$, so it takes $O(n)$ space.
    
    2. **Prefix Violations Array:**
        - We store a `prefix_violations` array of size $n+1$, so it also takes $O(n)$ space.

    3. **Answer Array:**
        - The `answer` array stores the result for each query, so it takes $O(q)$ space, where $q$ is the number of queries.

    **Total Space Complexity:**
        - $O(n + q)$, where $n$ is the size of the `nums` array and $q$ is the number of queries.
