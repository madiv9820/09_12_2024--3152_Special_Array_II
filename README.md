- ## Approach 2:- Binary Search

    - ### Intuition
        The goal is to determine whether a subarray of `nums` (specified by each query) is "special." A subarray is considered "special" if every pair of adjacent elements in the subarray contains numbers with different parity (one odd and one even).

        - ### Key Observations:
            - We need to find subarrays where no two adjacent elements have the same parity. This means we need to check if any violation (i.e., adjacent elements having the same parity) exists within the query range.
            - Instead of checking each subarray directly for every query, we can precompute the indices where violations occur and use binary search to quickly check for violations within the given range for each query.

    - ### Approach
        1. **Precompute Violations:**
            - Iterate through the `nums` array and record indices where two adjacent elements have the same parity. Store these indices in the `violation_indices` array.
        
        2. **Binary Search for Each Query:**
            - For each query, perform a binary search on `violation_indices` to check if there are any violations within the range `[start, end-1]` (adjusted to the query bounds).
            - If a violation exists in this range, the subarray is not special.
            - Otherwise, the subarray is special.

        3. **Return Results:**
            - For each query, append the result (`true` if the subarray is special, `false` otherwise) to the `answer` vector.

    - ### Code Implementation
        - **Python Solution**
            ```python3 []
            class Solution:
                def isArraySpecial(self, nums: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[bool]:

                    for index in range(n - 1):
                        # Check if current element and next element have the same parity.
                        if (nums[index] & 1) == (nums[index + 1] & 1):
                            # If they do, store the index of the violation.
                            violations_indices.append(index)

                    # Loop through each query to check if the subarray from start to end is special.

                        left, right = 0, len(violations_indices) - 1

                        # Perform binary search to find any violations in the range [s, e-1].
                        while left <= right:
                            mid = (left + right) // 2  # Find the middle index of the violations list.
                            
                            # If there's a violation within the range, mark the subarray as not special.
                            if start <= violations_indices[mid] <= end - 1:
                                special = False
                                break  # Exit the loop once a violation is found.
                            
                            # If the current violation is before the start of the range, move the left pointer to mid+1.
                            elif violations_indices[mid] < start:
                                left = mid + 1
                            # If the current violation is after the end of the range, move the right pointer to mid-1.
                            else:
                                right = mid - 1

                        # Append the result (True if no violation was found, False otherwise).

    - ### Time Complexity
        - **Preprocessing (Identifying Violations):**
            - We loop through the `nums` array once to find all violations. This takes $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the `nums` array.
    
        - **Query Processing (Binary Search):**
            - For each query, we perform a binary search on the `violation_indices` array, which takes $O(\log k)$, where $k$ is the number of violations (i.e., the number of indices in `violation_indices`).

        - **Overall Time Complexity:**
            - The total time complexity is $(O(n + q \log k))$, where $q$ is the number of queries.

    - ### Space Complexity
        - We use an additional array, `violation_indices`, to store the indices of violations. The space complexity is $O(k)$, where $k$ is the number of violations found.

        - The space complexity for the result array `answer` is $O(q)$, where $q$ is the number of queries.

        - **Overall Space Complexity:**
            - The total space complexity is $O(k + q)$, where $k$ is the number of violations and $q$ is the number of queries.
